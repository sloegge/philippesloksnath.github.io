# Open Science
I value scientific integrity because it brings together core principles that are essential for building and maintaining trust among scientists and between science and society. Adherence to honesty, transparency, and accountability is in my view crucial for the accumulation of reliable, cumulative knowledge. Thus, I strive to make my research as transparent and reproducible as possible. 
Please reach out if anything is unclear, insufficiently reported, not reproducible, or if you have suggestions for improvement, or if you just want to informally chat about Open Science.
